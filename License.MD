# GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
## Version 3, 29 June 2007

### Copyright (C) 2024 Kobot AI Labs

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

## Preamble

The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works. This license is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a programâ€”to ensure it remains free software for all its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to ensure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software and share your changes with others, and that you are not forced to accept a particular software license.

## Terms and Conditions

### 0. Definitions

This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program" refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)

Each licensee is addressed as "you".

### 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; and that you post a copy of this License along with the Program.

### 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

   a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

   b) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who receives a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This includes the source code and any binary or executable versions of the work.

   c) You must keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

### 3. You may not sell the source code of the Program or any modifications made to it. You may use the software created from the source code within any non-commercial software application.

### 4. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.

### 5. This License is intended to ensure that the source code remains free and that any derivative works are also distributed under the same license.

## Conclusion

This license guarantees your freedom to use, modify, and distribute the software while ensuring that the same freedoms are preserved for all users. By adhering to the terms of this license, you contribute to the open-source community and help maintain the integrity of free software.
